# 1. Introduction of the Project

After a long study of the climate in the capitals of Spain, it's possible to provide weather conditions during recent years. To define this, data from the past five years (2018-2022) is utilized; this helps to reduce the impact of outliers or anomalous conditions that may occur in a single year. The data that was used in this project was collected and processed in a previous project called "Climate Change in Spain with Animation". 

In addition, the data from these cities were grouped together to estimate the impact of weather conditions on the autonomous communities and the country (Spain).

The climate variables analyzed are mean temperature, total precipitation, and maximum wind speed. 

This analysis identifies:

- The top ten locations in Spain with the highest climate variable, either for a particular month or based on the annual average.

- Months in descending order based on the average temperature, total precipitation, or wind speed to a specific location.
    
Just so you know, this analysis does not focus on climate change. If you want to see information about this, please visit my project Climate Change in the Capital Cities of Spain, where data was analyzed from 1963.
